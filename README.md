# Practical Data Workshops | 4:15-6pm

## Part I: Collecting and Protecting Your Data, Nick Wolf and Vicky Steeves, NYU Libraries, Data Services: 45 minutes (20 Cooper Square, Room 222)

In this workshop we’ll talk about recommended practices at different times in the research life cycle, from the gathering of data and research materials to personal archiving and sharing project data. We’ll focus on helpful workflow tools for managing data such as the Open Science Framework, options for short-term storage, and ways to approach long term preservation, sharing, and distribution.

## Part II: Free and Open Source Digital Tools, Nick Wolf and Vicky Steeves, NYU Libraries, Data Services: 45 minutes (20 Cooper Square, Room 222)

Recent years have seen an explosion of higher-quality, community-supported researcher tools for working on digital projects. In this workshop we’ll engage collectively in a conversation about what tools have been effective, what we need to know about community development, and preview a few select tools that are useful to current researchers working in web publishing, project management, data cleaning and preparing, and spatial analysis.
